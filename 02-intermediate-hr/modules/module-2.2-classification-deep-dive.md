## Module Overview

Position classification is the foundation of federal pay equity and organizational structure. This module provides in-depth training on classifying General Schedule (GS) positions using OPM standards and the Factor Evaluation System.

**Key Topics**:
- Factor Evaluation System (FES) deep dive
- Writing position descriptions
- Desk audits and position reviews
- Classification appeals
- Supervisory vs. Non-supervisory positions
- Special situations (interdisciplinary, trainee positions)

---

## Part 1: Factor Evaluation System (FES) Overview (2 hours)

### 1.1 What is the Factor Evaluation System?

**FES** is OPM's point-based system for evaluating and classifying most General Schedule (GS) positions.

**9 Classification Factors**:
1. Knowledge Required by the Position
2. Supervisory Controls
3. Guidelines
4. Complexity
5. Scope and Effect
6. Personal Contacts
7. Purpose of Contacts
8. Physical Demands
9. Work Environment

**How FES Works**:
- Each factor assigned a level (1-9, depending on factor)
- Each level has assigned point value
- Total points determine GS grade
- Grade-point conversion table used

### 1.2 GS Grade Point Ranges

| Grade | Minimum Points | Maximum Points |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| GS-5 | 855 | 1100 |
| GS-6 | 1105 | 1350 |
| GS-7 | 1355 | 1600 |
| GS-8 | 1605 | 1850 |
| GS-9 | 1855 | 2100 |
| GS-10 | 2105 | 2350 |
| GS-11 | 2355 | 2750 |
| GS-12 | 2755 | 3150 |
| GS-13 | 3155 | 3600 |
| GS-14 | 3605 | 4050 |
| GS-15 | 4055+ | -- |

**Example**:
If a position evaluates to 2,400 total points → GS-11

### 1.3 Primary vs. Coverage Standards

**Primary Standard**: Applies directly to position (e.g., GS-201 HR Management Series)

**Coverage Standard**: Applies when no primary standard exists (FES is a coverage standard)

**OPM Classification Standards** (over 400 series):
- Found at: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/classifying-general-schedule-positions/
- Examples:
  - GS-0343 Management and Program Analysis
  - GS-1102 Contracting
  - GS-2210 Information Technology Management

## Part 3: Writing Position Descriptions (2 hours)

### 3.1 Required Elements of a Position Description

**Every PD Must Include**:
1. **Position Information**:
   - Position title
   - Series and grade
   - Organizational location
   - Supervisory/non-supervisory designation

2. **Major Duties and Responsibilities** (Critical!):
   - 5-10 major duty paragraphs
   - Listed in descending order of importance
   - Include approximate % of time for each
   - Must cover at least 90% of work time

3. **Factor Level Descriptions** (for FES positions):
   - Narrative for each of 9 factors
   - Must justify assigned level

4. **Supervisory/Managerial Responsibilities** (if applicable)

5. **Other Significant Facts** (if applicable):
   - Special requirements (security clearance, travel, etc.)

### 3.2 Writing Major Duties - Best Practices

**Formula**: Action Verb + Object + Purpose/Result

**Good Examples**:
```
✓ "Reviews employee grievances to determine compliance with
   collective bargaining agreement and recommends appropriate
   resolution strategies to management."

✓ "Analyzes organizational structures to identify inefficiencies
   and develops recommendations to improve operational effectiveness
   and reduce costs."

✓ "Conducts comprehensive audits of internal control systems to
   ensure compliance with Federal financial management requirements
   and identifies areas of risk."
```

**Poor Examples** (Too Vague):
```
✗ "Performs HR duties as assigned."

✗ "Assists supervisor with various tasks."

✗ "Handles correspondence."
```

**Common Mistakes**:
1. **Too generic**: "Performs other duties as assigned" (delete this!)
2. **Task-level detail**: Should describe outcomes, not step-by-step tasks
3. **Outdated duties**: Must reflect CURRENT work
4. **Missing percentages**: Each duty should show % of time

**Recommended Format**:
```
1. **Employee Relations** (40% of time)

   Investigates and resolves complex employee relations issues
   including conduct and performance matters, workplace disputes,
   and grievances. Analyzes cases for compliance with merit systems
   principles, collective bargaining agreements, and agency policies.
   Advises management on appropriate disciplinary actions and
   conducts alternative dispute resolution sessions.

2. **Labor Relations** (30% of time)

   Serves as agency representative in labor-management partnership
   meetings. Interprets and applies provisions of collective
   bargaining agreements to resolve disputes. Participates in
   collective bargaining negotiations and drafts management proposals.
   Coordinates responses to unfair labor practice charges.
```

### 3.3 Common Position Description Errors

**Error 1: Confusing Position with Person**
```
❌ "John has 15 years of HR experience and a PHR certification."
✓ Position descriptions describe the POSITION, not the incumbent
```

**Error 2: Inflated Duties**
```
❌ Clerk position states: "Develops agency-wide HR policy"
✓ Duties must match actual responsibilities and grade level
```

**Error 3: Accretion of Duties**
```
Problem: Position gradually accumulates higher-graded work but PD never updated
Solution: Annual PD review, desk audits every 2-3 years
```

**Error 4: Copy-Paste from Other PDs**
```
❌ Using generic template without customization
✓ Each PD must reflect unique duties of that specific position
```

## Part 4: Desk Audits and Position Reviews (1.5 hours)

### 4.1 What is a Desk Audit?

**Desk Audit**: Systematic review of a position to verify:
- Position Description (PD) accurately reflects current duties
- Position properly classified (correct series, grade, title)
- Incumbent performing duties at assigned grade level

**When to Conduct Desk Audits**:
- Employee requests classification review
- Supervisor believes position under/over graded
- Significant change in duties (reorganization, new mission)
- Periodic review (every 3-5 years recommended)
- Classification appeal filed

### 4.2 Desk Audit Process

**Step 1: Preparation**
- Review current position description
- Review organizational chart
- Review similar positions for comparison
- Schedule interview with incumbent and supervisor

**Step 2: Incumbent Interview**
- Confirm major duties and % of time
- Identify any duties not in current PD
- Understand complexity, guidelines, supervision received
- Verify contacts (who, why, how often)
- Duration: 1-2 hours

**Step 3: Supervisor Interview**
- Confirm work assigned and supervisory controls
- Verify scope and effect of work
- Understand organizational context
- Duration: 30-60 minutes

**Step 4: Work Review**
- Request work samples (reports, emails, analyses)
- Review actual products to verify complexity level
- Compare to position description claims

**Step 5: Classification Analysis**
- Apply FES or appropriate standard
- Evaluate each factor independently
- Calculate total points
- Determine correct series, grade, title

**Step 6: Report and Decision**
- Document findings
- If changes needed: Draft new PD, coordinate approvals
- If no changes: Document rationale for maintaining current classification
- Timeline: Complete within 30-60 days

### 4.3 Desk Audit Documentation

**Required Documentation**:
1. **Desk Audit Worksheet**: Factor-by-factor evaluation with point totals
2. **Interview Notes**: Summary of incumbent and supervisor interviews
3. **Work Samples**: Examples of work products reviewed
4. **Comparison Analysis**: How position compares to similar positions
5. **Classification Decision**: Final determination with rationale

---

## Part 5: Classification Appeals (1 hour)

### 5.1 Employee Right to Appeal

**Regulatory Authority**: 5 CFR Part 511, Subpart F

**Employees may appeal**:
- Series
- Grade
- Title
- All three

**Cannot appeal**:
- Qualification requirements
- Pay or promotion decisions
- Organizational structure

### 5.2 Appeal Process

**Step 1: Agency Appeal** (Required First Step)
- Employee files appeal with agency classifier
- Must file within 15 days of receiving classification decision
- Agency has 30 days to decide

**Step 2: OPM Appeal** (If employee disagrees with agency)
- Appeal to OPM within 15 days of agency decision
- OPM conducts independent review
- May include desk audit by OPM classifier
- OPM decision is FINAL (not subject to further appeal)

**OPM Decision Timeline**:
- Initial review: 60-90 days
- Desk audit (if needed): 120+ days

### 5.3 Classification Appeal Decision Outcomes

**Possible Outcomes**:
1. **Sustained**: Current classification correct
2. **Upgraded**: Position classified higher (retroactive to appeal filing date)
3. **Downgraded**: Position classified lower (protected from pay loss for 2 years)

**If Employee Wins (Upgraded)**:
- Effective date is date of appeal filing
- Back pay owed from appeal filing date
- Position reclassified going forward

**If Agency Wins (Sustained)**:
- Current classification remains
- No back pay

**If Downgraded**:
- Rare but possible
- Employee protected under "saved pay" for 2 years
- After 2 years, salary frozen until position salary catches up

---

## Part 6: Supervisory Positions (1 hour)

### 6.1 Supervisor vs. Leader vs. Team Leader

**Critical Distinctions**:

**Supervisor**:
- Makes final personnel decisions (hiring, firing, discipline)
- Conducts performance appraisals that count
- Approves leave
- Controls work assignments
- Title includes "Supervisory" (e.g., Supervisory HR Specialist)
- Receives 25% supervisory differential (GS-13+) or 10% (GS-12 and below)

**Leader** (Non-supervisory):
- Coordinates work of others
- Provides technical direction
- Does NOT make final personnel decisions
- Title includes "Lead" (e.g., Lead Contract Specialist)
- Receives 8% leader differential

**Team Leader** (Temporary assignment):
- Temporary duty (not permanent position description)
- Usually 120 days or less
- No differential
- Returns to regular duties when assignment ends

**Common Mistake**: Calling someone "supervisor" when they don't have authority

### 6.2 General Schedule Supervisory Guide (GSSG)

**Used to Classify Supervisory Positions**

**Six Factors**:
1. **Program Scope and Effect**
2. **Organizational Setting**
3. **Supervisory/Managerial Authority Exercised**
4. **Personal Contacts** (Nature and Purpose)
5. **Difficulty of Typical Work Directed**
6. **Other Conditions**

**GSSG Grade Determination**:
- Base grade (from Factor 5: Grade of work supervised)
- Add grades for other factors
- Example:
  - Factor 5: GS-11 work supervised = Base grade GS-11
  - Factors 1-4, 6 add: +2 grades
  - Supervisor position: GS-13

### 6.3 Supervisory Coverage

**Minimum Requirements for Supervisory Position**:
- Supervise at least **25% of time**
- Supervise at least **2 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees**
- Exercise full supervisory authority

**If Below Minimums**: Position is non-supervisory lead, not supervisor

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Factor Evaluation Practice

Evaluate the following position using FES:

**Position**: Management Analyst, GS-0343-??

**Major Duties**:
- Conducts studies of administrative programs to improve efficiency
- Analyzes organizational structures and recommends changes
- Develops performance metrics and conducts program evaluations
- Presents findings to senior management

**Guidelines**: General agency policies; must adapt approaches to specific situations

**Supervision**: Supervisor assigns broad objectives; employee plans and executes independently

**Complexity**: Analyzes interrelated program issues; develops creative solutions

**Contacts**: Regular contact with program managers across agency to coordinate studies (Level P2/c)

**Questions**:
1. Evaluate each of the 9 factors and assign levels
2. Calculate total points
3. What is the correct grade?

### Exercise 2: Position Description Writing

Write a major duty paragraph for a Contract Specialist that:
- Describes pre-award contract analysis
- Shows complexity of evaluating proposals
- Indicates 35% of time
- Demonstrates GS-11 level work

### Exercise 3: Desk Audit Scenario

You conduct a desk audit for Jennifer Smith, GS-0201-11 HR Specialist:
- Current PD states: "Provides basic HR support, processes routine personnel actions"
- Interview reveals: "I independently resolve complex employee relations cases, advise managers on disciplinary actions, interpret labor agreements"
- Supervisor confirms: "Jennifer is my go-to person for tough ER cases"

**Questions**:
1. Does the PD accurately reflect the work?
2. What factor levels might be understated?
3. Should you recommend reclassification? To what grade?

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **FES has 9 factors** - each evaluated independently
2. **Total points determine grade** - use conversion table
3. **Position descriptions must be accurate** - describe position, not person
4. **Desk audits verify classification** - compare actual work to PD
5. **Employees have appeal rights** - agency first, then OPM
6. **Supervisor requires authority** - not just coordination
7. **Annual PD reviews prevent accretion** - keep PDs current
8. **Documentation is critical** - support all classification decisions
