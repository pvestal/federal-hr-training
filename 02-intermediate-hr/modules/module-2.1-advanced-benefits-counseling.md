## Part 1: Complex FEHB Scenarios (2 hours)

### 1.1 FEHB During Extended LWOP

**Regulatory Authority**: 5 CFR § 890.303

**Key Rules**:
- FEHB continues during approved LWOP in **non-pay status** for up to **365 days**
- Employee must pay **both** employee and government share of premiums
- Payment must be made in advance or employee coverage terminates
- After 365 days, employee may continue for certain approved reasons (military, compensable injury)

**Scenario Example**:
```
Employee: John Smith, GS-12
Current FEHB: Blue Cross Blue Shield Family Plan
Employee share: $380/biweekly
Government share: $820/biweekly
Total: $1,200/biweekly ($2,600/month)

Going on LWOP: 6 months (unpaid medical leave)
```

**Counseling Steps**:
1. Calculate total premium cost: $2,600/month × 6 months = $15,600
2. Explain payment options:
   - Pay in advance before LWOP starts
   - Pay bi-weekly via direct pay
   - Pay monthly via billing
3. Explain consequences of non-payment: Immediate termination of coverage
4. Explain re-enrollment when returning to pay status
5. Discuss alternatives (spouse's insurance, COBRA if separating)

**Documentation Required**:
- SF-2809 if enrollment changes
- LWOP approval documentation
- Premium payment arrangement

### 1.2 FEHB and Military Service

**Regulatory Authority**: 5 CFR § 890.304

**Special Rules for Military Leave**:
- Federal employees called to active duty can continue FEHB
- No premium payment required if serving in uniformed service
- Covered under both TRICARE (military) and FEHB
- FEHB is primary payer

**Coordination of Benefits**:
- FEHB pays first
- TRICARE pays second (covers remaining costs)
- No need to disenroll from FEHB
- Automatically re-enrolled upon return to federal service

**Counseling Points**:
1. Keep FEHB active - no cost during active duty
2. TRICARE + FEHB provides comprehensive coverage
3. Family members covered under both
4. Inform payroll of military orders
5. Re-enrollment automatic upon return

### 1.3 FEHB Portability for Retirees

**Regulatory Authority**: 5 CFR § 890.302

**Requirements to Continue FEHB into Retirement**:
1. Enrolled in FEHB for **5 years immediately before retirement** (or all service if less than 5 years)
2. Eligible for immediate annuity (not deferred retirement)
3. Retired under FERS or CSRS

**"5 Years Immediately Before" Rule**:
- Continuous enrollment in FEHB for 5 consecutive years
- Includes periods of approved LWOP where premiums were paid
- Does NOT include periods without FEHB enrollment

**Common Mistake**:
Employee worked 20 years, but only enrolled in FEHB for last 3 years because spouse had insurance. **NOT eligible** to continue FEHB into retirement.

**Waiver of 5-Year Rule**:
- Involuntary separation (RIF, disability)
- If agency failed to properly notify of FEHB eligibility

---

## Part 2: FERS Retirement Eligibility - Advanced Calculations (2 hours)

### 2.1 FERS Retirement Categories

**Three Categories of FERS Employees**:

1. **FERS Original** (hired before 2013)
   - Employee contribution: 0.8% of basic pay
   - Full retirement formula: 1% × High-3 × Years of Service
   - MRA + 30 years (unreduced)
   - Age 60 + 20 years (unreduced)
   - Age 62 + 5 years (unreduced)

2. **FERS-RAE** (Revised Annuity Employees, hired 2013-2014)
   - Employee contribution: 3.1% of basic pay
   - Same retirement formula as FERS Original
   - Same eligibility requirements

3. **FERS-FRAE** (Further Revised Annuity Employees, hired 2014+)
   - Employee contribution: 4.4% of basic pay
   - Same retirement formula as FERS Original
   - Same eligibility requirements

**Minimum Retirement Age (MRA)**:
| Birth Year | MRA |
|-----------|-----|
| Before 1948 | 55 |
| 1948 | 55 + 2 months |
| 1949 | 55 + 4 months |
| 1950 | 55 + 6 months |
| 1951 | 55 + 8 months |
| 1952 | 55 + 10 months |
| 1953-1964 | 56 |
| 1965 | 56 + 2 months |
| 1966 | 56 + 4 months |
| 1967 | 56 + 6 months |
| 1968 | 56 + 8 months |
| 1969 | 56 + 10 months |
| 1970 and after | 57 |

### 2.2 FERS Retirement Calculation Examples

**Example 1: MRA + 30 (Unreduced)**
```
Employee: Sarah Johnson
Born: March 15, 1968
MRA: 56 + 8 months = Age 56 years, 8 months
Eligible date: November 15, 2024

Service: 30 years, 6 months
High-3 Salary: $95,000

Calculation:
1% × $95,000 × 30.5 years = $28,975/year
Monthly annuity: $2,414.58/month
```

**Example 2: Age 62 + 5 (Unreduced)**
```
Employee: Michael Chen
Born: June 1, 1963
Retirement date: June 1, 2025 (age 62)

Service: 12 years, 3 months
High-3 Salary: $110,000

Calculation:
1% × $110,000 × 12.25 years = $13,475/year
Monthly annuity: $1,122.92/month
```

**Example 3: MRA + 10 (Reduced - Age Penalty)**
```
Employee: Lisa Rodriguez
Born: January 10, 1969
MRA: 56 + 10 months = Age 56 years, 10 months
Retirement date: November 10, 2025

Service: 15 years
High-3 Salary: $85,000
Age at retirement: 56 years, 10 months (MRA)

Calculation:
Base annuity: 1% × $85,000 × 15 years = $12,750/year

Age penalty: Retired at MRA with <30 years service
Penalty: 5% per year under age 62
Years under 62: 5 years, 2 months = 5.167 years
Total penalty: 5% × 5.167 = 25.83%

Reduced annuity: $12,750 × (1 - 0.2583) = $9,455.78/year
Monthly annuity: $787.98/month
```

### 2.3 FERS Supplement

**Eligibility**:
- Retired under MRA + 30 or Age 60 + 20
- Not eligible if retired under Age 62 + 5 or MRA + 10
- Paid from retirement until age 62
- Approximates Social Security benefit

**Calculation**:
```
Formula: (Years of FERS service / 40) × Social Security benefit at age 62

Example:
Employee: David Martinez
FERS Service: 30 years
Estimated Social Security at age 62: $1,800/month

FERS Supplement:
(30 / 40) × $1,800 = 0.75 × $1,800 = $1,350/month

Supplement paid from retirement (age 56) until age 62 (6 years)
Total supplement received: $1,350 × 72 months = $97,200
```

**Earnings Limitation**:
- Subject to Social Security earnings test
- 2025 limit: $22,320/year ($1,860/month)
- Reduction: $1 for every $2 over limit
- Only applies to earned income (wages), not investment income

## Part 3: TSP Advanced Strategies (1.5 hours)

### 3.1 Traditional vs. Roth TSP

**Key Differences**:
| Feature | Traditional TSP | Roth TSP |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Contributions | Pre-tax (reduces current taxable income) | After-tax (no current tax benefit) |
| Tax on contributions | Not taxed now | Taxed now |
| Tax on withdrawal | Fully taxable | Tax-free (if qualified) |
| Agency matching | Always goes to Traditional | Always goes to Traditional |
| Required Minimum Distributions | Yes, starting at age 72 | Yes, starting at age 72 |

**When to Choose Traditional**:
- Expect to be in lower tax bracket in retirement
- Need immediate tax deduction to reduce current tax burden
- Early-mid career with moderate income

**When to Choose Roth**:
- Expect to be in same or higher tax bracket in retirement
- Want tax-free income in retirement
- Young employees with long time horizon
- High earners who want tax diversification

**Optimal Strategy**: Split contributions between both (e.g., 60% Traditional, 40% Roth)

### 3.2 TSP Contribution Limits (2025)

**Regular Contribution Limit**: $23,000/year ($1,916.67/month)

**Catch-Up Contributions** (age 50+): Additional $7,500/year ($625/month)
- Total limit for age 50+: $30,500/year

**Agency Matching**:
- Automatic 1% (even if employee contributes 0%)
- Match up to 5% total:
  - First 3%: Dollar-for-dollar match
  - Next 2%: $0.50 per dollar

**Example - Maximizing Match**:
```
Employee Salary: $100,000
Employee contributes: 5% = $5,000/year
Agency contributions:
  - Automatic 1%: $1,000
  - Match on first 3%: $3,000
  - Match on next 2%: $1,000
Total agency: $5,000/year

Total TSP contributions: $10,000/year (10% of salary)
```

**CRITICAL COUNSELING POINT**: Employees MUST contribute at least 5% to get full agency match. Contributing less = leaving free money on the table!

### 3.3 TSP Lifecycle Funds

**What are Lifecycle (L) Funds?**:
- "Set it and forget it" diversified portfolios
- Automatically rebalance as retirement approaches
- Managed to a target retirement date

**Available L Funds** (as of 2025):
- L 2030, L 2035, L 2040, L 2045, L 2050, L 2055, L 2060, L 2065, L Income

**How to Choose**:
- Select fund closest to expected retirement year
- L Income for those already retired or very conservative

**Asset Allocation Example - L 2040 Fund** (for retirement around 2040):
- 30% G Fund (Government Securities) - Safe
- 8% F Fund (Fixed Income) - Bonds
- 28% C Fund (Common Stock - S&P 500)
- 17% S Fund (Small Cap US stocks)
- 17% I Fund (International stocks)

**Gradually becomes more conservative** as target date approaches.

## Part 4: Survivor Benefits and Beneficiary Designations (1.5 hours)

### 4.1 FERS Survivor Benefits

**Automatic Spousal Survivor Annuity**:
- Default: 50% of employee annuity continues to surviving spouse
- Cost: Reduction of employee annuity by 10%
- Irrevocable after retirement (can't change without spouse consent)

**Example**:
```
Employee monthly annuity (unreduced): $3,000/month

With survivor benefit:
Employee receives: $3,000 × 0.90 = $2,700/month (-10%)
Upon employee death, spouse receives: $3,000 × 0.50 = $1,500/month

Without survivor benefit:
Employee receives: $3,000/month
Upon employee death, spouse receives: $0
```

**Waiving Survivor Annuity**:
- Requires spouse's notarized consent
- May make sense if:
  - Spouse has own retirement income
  - Employee has life insurance
  - Spouse is significantly younger (actuarial advantage)

### 4.2 FEGLI (Federal Employee Group Life Insurance) Beneficiaries

**Designation Form**: SF-2823

**Order of Precedence** (if no designation or designation invalid):
1. Widow or widower
2. Children (equally, or to survivors)
3. Parents (equally, or to survivor)
4. Executor/Administrator of estate
5. Next of kin under state law

**CRITICAL COUNSELING POINT**: Beneficiary designation OVERRIDES will!

**Common Mistakes**:
- Not updating after divorce (ex-spouse still receives death benefit!)
- Not updating after remarriage
- Designating minor children directly (requires court-appointed guardian)
- Forgetting to name contingent beneficiaries

**Best Practice**: Review beneficiary designations:
- After marriage, divorce, remarriage
- After birth or adoption of child
- After death of named beneficiary
- Every 3-5 years

### 4.3 TSP Beneficiary Designations

**Designation Form**: Form TSP-3

**Beneficiary Types**:
- Primary beneficiaries (receive first)
- Contingent beneficiaries (receive if primary deceased)

**Allocation**:
- Can designate percentages to multiple beneficiaries
- Must total 100% for each category

**Example**:
```
Primary Beneficiaries:
  - Spouse (Jane Doe): 60%
  - Son (John Doe Jr.): 20%
  - Daughter (Sarah Doe): 20%

Contingent Beneficiaries:
  - Brother (Michael Doe): 100%
```

**Spouse Protection Rule**:
- If married, spouse automatically receives 100% unless spouse consents to other designation
- Consent must be notarized

## Part 5: Disability Retirement (1 hour)

### 5.1 FERS Disability Retirement Eligibility

**Requirements**:
1. At least **18 months of federal service**
2. Unable to perform duties of current position
3. Agency unable to accommodate disability
4. Disability expected to last at least 1 year
5. Application filed within 1 year of separation

**Application Form**: SF-3112 (FERS Disability Application)

**Supporting Documentation**:
- Medical documentation from physician
- Supervisor's statement on inability to perform duties
- Accommodation attempts

### 5.2 FERS Disability Annuity Calculation

**First Year of Disability**:
- 60% of High-3 salary
- Minus 100% of any Social Security disability benefits

**After First Year**:
- 40% of High-3 salary
- Minus 60% of any Social Security disability benefits

**At Age 62**:
- Converts to regular FERS retirement calculation
- Based on years of service at disability + disability period

**Example**:
```
Employee: Jennifer Smith
High-3 Salary: $80,000
Years of service at disability: 12 years
Social Security disability: $1,500/month = $18,000/year

Year 1:
FERS disability: 60% × $80,000 = $48,000
Minus Social Security: $48,000 - $18,000 = $30,000/year ($2,500/month)

Years 2+:
FERS disability: 40% × $80,000 = $32,000
Minus 60% of SS: $32,000 - (0.60 × $18,000) = $21,200/year ($1,767/month)
```

**Earnings Limitation**:
- Can earn up to 80% of current grade/step
- If earnings exceed 80%, disability annuity may terminate

## Part 6: Dual-Career Federal Couples (30 minutes)

### 6.1 FEHB for Dual-Federal Couples

**Options**:
1. **Both enroll separately** (Self Only each)
   - Advantage: Each maintains independent coverage
   - Disadvantage: Higher total cost
   - When to use: Both have high health needs

2. **One enrolls Self and Family, other waives**
   - Advantage: Lower total premium
   - Disadvantage: If enrollee separates, spouse may not have immediate coverage
   - When to use: Stable employment for enrollee

3. **Both enroll**: One Self and Family, other Self Only
   - Advantage: Backup coverage if one retires
   - Disadvantage: Highest cost
   - When to use: Planning for staggered retirement

**Best Practice**: Consider retirement planning timeline when choosing

### 6.2 TSP for Dual-Federal Couples

**Strategy**: Maximize agency matching for BOTH employees
- Each should contribute at least 5% to get full match
- Coordinate Traditional vs. Roth contributions for tax optimization
- Consider different risk tolerance (one conservative, one aggressive)

**Tax Optimization Example**:
```
Spouse 1: GS-14, $110,000 salary
  - Traditional TSP: 8% ($8,800)
  - Reduces taxable income significantly

Spouse 2: GS-11, $75,000 salary
  - Roth TSP: 10% ($7,500)
  - Builds tax-free retirement income

Combined strategy: Tax deduction now + Tax-free growth for future
```
