## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Confusing 31-day vs. 60-day deadline for newborns**
   - Adding newborn to Self Only = 31 days
   - All other changes including Family = 60 days

2. **Counting deadline incorrectly**
   - Count from date of EVENT, not date employee tells you
   - Include weekends and holidays

3. **Accepting incomplete documentation**
   - All QLEs require proof
   - "Pending" divorce is not a QLE (must be final)

4. **Allowing changes that don't qualify**
   - "I don't like my plan" is NOT a QLE
   - Premium increases are NOT QLEs

5. **Processing late requests**
   - If beyond 60 days, must deny
   - Employee must wait for Open Season

---

## Helpful Tips

- **Calendar the 60-day deadline** when employee reports life event
- **Proactively reach out** to employees who may have QLEs (birth announcements, PCS orders)
- **Provide SF-2809** and documentation list immediately
- **Keep checklist** of required documents for each QLE type
- **When in doubt**, consult 5 CFR § 890.301 or contact OPM
