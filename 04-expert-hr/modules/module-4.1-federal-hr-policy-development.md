## Part 1: Legal Framework for Federal HR Policy (2 hours)

### 1.1 Hierarchy of Federal HR Authority

**1. United States Code (USC)**
- Title 5 - Government Organization and Employees
- Enacted by Congress, signed by President
- Highest legal authority
- Example: 5 USC § 3301 (Civil Service authority)

**2. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)**
- Title 5 - Administrative Personnel
- Regulations issued by OPM
- Implement and interpret USC
- Have force of law
- Example: 5 CFR Part 300 (Employment)

**3. OPM Policy Guidance**
- OPM Policy Guidance Letters
- Benefits Administration Letters
- Classification Policy Letters
- Advisory, but authoritative

**4. Agency Policy**
- Must comply with USC, CFR, OPM guidance
- Can be more restrictive, not less
- Tailored to agency mission

**Example Hierarchy**:
```
5 USC § 6301 → Annual leave
5 CFR § 630 → Annual leave regulations (details)
OPM Leave Administration Guide → Interpretation
Agency Policy → "Annual leave requests must be submitted 2 weeks in advance"
                (Agency can require this, not prohibited by higher authority)
```

### 1.2 Limits of Agency Authority

**Agencies CANNOT**:
❌ Waive requirements in USC or CFR
❌ Create policies less protective than law/regulation
❌ Discriminate based on protected characteristics
❌ Violate collective bargaining agreements
❌ Violate Merit Systems Principles

**Agencies CAN**:
✅ Be more restrictive than regulations (if not prohibited)
✅ Fill gaps where regulations are silent
✅ Tailor policies to mission needs
✅ Delegate authority within organization

**Example**:
```
5 CFR requires 30 days annual leave for 15+ years service.
Agency CAN:    Grant 40 days annual leave (more generous)
Agency CANNOT: Grant only 25 days annual leave (less than regulation)
```

### 1.3 Merit Systems Principles (5 USC § 2301)

**All HR policies must support Merit Systems Principles**:

1. Recruit qualified individuals from all segments of society
2. All employees fair and equitable treatment
3. Equal pay for work of equal value
4. High standards of integrity, conduct, concern for public interest
5. Efficient and effective use of workforce
6. Retain employees based on performance, separate inadequate performers
7. Provide for employee education and training
8. Protect employees against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, coercion
9. Protect employees against reprisal for whistleblowing

**Policy Development Test**: Ask "Does this policy support or violate MSPs?"

---

## Part 2: Policy Development Process (2.5 hours)

### 2.1 Identifying Need for Policy

**Triggers for New/Revised Policy**:
1. **New law or regulation** (e.g., new CFR amendment)
2. **OPM guidance** (e.g., Benefits Administration Letter)
3. **Agency reorganization** (e.g., new mission requirements)
4. **Operational gaps** (e.g., employees uncertain about procedures)
5. **Audit findings** (e.g., GAO/OIG recommendations)
6. **Inconsistent application** (e.g., different practices across divisions)

**Example**:
```
Trigger: OPM issues new telework guidance during COVID-19
Need: Agency must update telework policy to comply with new guidance
       and clarify eligibility, approval process, equipment
```

### 2.2 Stakeholder Analysis

**Identify All Stakeholders**:
- **Primary**: Employees/supervisors directly affected
- **Secondary**: HR staff implementing policy
- **Tertiary**: Union (if applicable), Legal, EEO, Budget, IT

**Stakeholder Engagement**:
1. Conduct focus groups with affected employees
2. Consult with union (if policy subject to bargaining)
3. Coordinate with Legal for sufficiency review
4. Engage IT for systems impact
5. Consult Budget for cost implications

**Example - Telework Policy Stakeholders**:
```
Primary: All employees, supervisors
Union: Must bargain impact and implementation
IT: Equipment, VPN capacity, security
Facilities: Office space reconfiguration
Legal: Liability, FOIA compliance
Budget: Equipment costs, office space savings
```

### 2.3 Policy Drafting Best Practices

**Policy Structure**:
1. **Purpose**: Why policy exists
2. **Scope**: Who/what it covers
3. **Definitions**: Key terms
4. **Policy Statement**: The actual policy
5. **Procedures**: Step-by-step implementation
6. **Responsibilities**: Who does what
7. **Authorities**: Legal citations
8. **Effective Date**: When policy takes effect
9. **Supersession**: What it replaces

**Writing Style**:
- Active voice ("Supervisors will approve" not "Approval will be given")
- Plain language (avoid legalese)
- Short sentences
- Numbered lists for procedures
- Examples where helpful

**Sample Policy Format**:
```
POLICY MEMORANDUM 25-08

## Part 3: Legal Sufficiency Review (2 hours)

### 3.1 Conducting Legal Review

**Legal Review Checklist**:

✅ **Compliance with USC**
   - Does policy conflict with any statute?
   - Does policy implement statutory requirement correctly?

✅ **Compliance with CFR**
   - Does policy align with OPM regulations?
   - Are there any CFR provisions policy doesn't address?

✅ **Compliance with OPM Guidance**
   - Does policy reflect latest OPM guidance?
   - Have all relevant OPM letters been considered?

✅ **Non-Discrimination**
   - Does policy have disparate impact on protected groups?
   - Are reasonable accommodations addressed?

✅ **Collective Bargaining**
   - Is policy subject to bargaining?
   - Have impact and implementation been negotiated?

✅ **Merit Systems Principles**
   - Does policy support or conflict with MSPs?
   - Have Prohibited Personnel Practices been avoided?

### 3.2 Common Legal Issues in HR Policy

**Issue 1: Improper Delegation**
```
❌ WRONG: "Division chiefs may waive probationary period requirements."
          (5 CFR § 315.802 doesn't authorize waiver)

✅ CORRECT: "Division chiefs may recommend extension of probationary
            period to HR Director for approval." (This is authorized)
```

**Issue 2: Conflicting with CFR**
```
❌ WRONG: "Employees may carry over 300 hours of annual leave."
          (5 CFR § 630.302 limits to 240 hours, 360 for SES)

✅ CORRECT: "Employees may carry over annual leave as authorized by
            5 CFR § 630.302 (240 hours for GS, 360 for SES)."
```

**Issue 3: Discrimination Risk**
```
❌ WRONG: "Telework available only to employees without childcare
           responsibilities." (Familial status discrimination)

✅ CORRECT: "Telework available to employees whose positions are
            suitable for remote work and who demonstrate ability
            to maintain performance standards."
```

### 3.3 OPM Pre-Decisional Review

**When to Consult OPM Before Implementing Policy**:
- Policy interpretation is unclear
- Agency wants to implement novel approach
- Policy has significant government-wide implications
- Risk of employee appeals/grievances

**How to Request OPM Review**:
1. Draft policy completely
2. Identify specific regulatory questions
3. Submit to OPM (Agency Liaison or Policy Office)
4. Provide rationale for agency approach
5. Request written opinion

**Example OPM Consultation**:
```
TO: OPM Policy Division
FROM: DOD HR Policy Office
RE: Interpretation of 5 CFR § 315.907 (Trial periods for supervisors)

Question: May agency require new supervisors to complete trial period
even if employee previously completed probationary period in non-
supervisory role?

Agency Position: Yes, 5 CFR § 315.907 requires trial period for
employees newly appointed to supervisory positions, regardless of
prior federal service.

Request: Confirmation that agency interpretation is correct.

[OPM Response would follow]
```

## Part 4: Policy Coordination and Approval (1.5 hours)

### 4.1 Internal Coordination Process

**Typical Coordination Path**:
1. **HR Staff Draft** → Initial policy development
2. **HR Management Review** → Check completeness, clarity
3. **Legal Review** → Legal sufficiency (see Part 3)
4. **Union Coordination** → Bargaining (if applicable)
5. **Stakeholder Review** → Affected divisions provide input
6. **Budget/Finance Review** → Cost implications
7. **IT Review** → Systems/technology impact
8. **EEO Review** → Non-discrimination compliance
9. **Senior Leadership Approval** → Final decision authority

**Timeline**: 60-180 days (depending on complexity)

### 4.2 Union Notification and Bargaining

**If Union Exists** (covered by 5 USC Chapter 71):

**Step 1: Determine Duty to Bargain**
- Is policy a "condition of employment"? (Usually yes for HR policies)
- Does existing CBA cover this topic?

**Step 2: Pre-Implementation Notification**
- Provide union draft policy
- Explain rationale and impact
- Invite union to request bargaining

**Step 3: Bargaining (if union requests)**
- Negotiate impact and implementation
- Reach agreement or impasse
- Document outcome in Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

**Step 4: Implementation**
- Implement agreed-upon policy
- Or implement after impasse procedures if no agreement

**Timeline**: Add 60-120 days for bargaining

**Example**:
```
Policy: New performance management procedures
Union Rights: Bargain impact and implementation (how procedures affect
              employees, how quickly implemented)
NOT Bargainable: Whether to have performance management (management right)
Result: Union and agency agree to 90-day phase-in period, training for
        all supervisors before implementation (documented in MOU)
```

### 4.3 Publication and Distribution

**Internal Publication**:
- Agency intranet (HR policy library)
- Email announcement to all employees
- Supervisor briefings
- HR staff training

**External Publication** (if required):
- Federal Register (for significant policies)
- Agency website (public-facing policies)

**Effective Date Considerations**:
- Minimum 30 days after announcement (allow preparation)
- Coordinate with pay period (if payroll impact)
- Coordinate with training completion
- Avoid holidays/blackout periods

---

## Part 5: Change Management and Implementation (1.5 hours)

### 5.1 Implementation Planning

**Implementation Plan Components**:
1. **Communication Strategy**
   - Who needs to know?
   - What messaging?
   - When announced?
   - How communicated?

2. **Training Plan**
   - Who needs training?
   - What training content?
   - Delivery method (online, in-person, hybrid)?
   - Timeline?

3. **Systems/Forms Updates**
   - New forms required?
   - Database/HRIS changes?
   - IT support needed?

4. **Monitoring and Compliance**
   - How to track compliance?
   - Who monitors?
   - Reporting requirements?

**Example - Telework Policy Implementation**:
```
Phase 1 (Months 1-2): Communication and Training
  - All-hands announcement
  - Supervisor training on evaluation criteria
  - Employee webinars on application process

Phase 2 (Month 3): Soft Launch
  - Begin accepting applications
  - Pilot with 2-3 divisions
  - Identify issues, adjust procedures

Phase 3 (Month 4): Full Implementation
  - All divisions accepting applications
  - Monitor approval rates, timelines
  - Gather feedback

Phase 4 (Months 5-6): Evaluation
  - Survey employees and supervisors
  - Analyze data (participation rates, performance impact)
  - Identify needed revisions
```

### 5.2 Resistance Management

**Common Sources of Resistance**:
- Fear of change
- Lack of understanding
- Perceived unfairness
- Increased workload
- Loss of autonomy

**Strategies to Address**:
1. **Early Involvement**: Include stakeholders in development
2. **Clear Communication**: Explain "why" behind policy
3. **Training**: Ensure everyone knows how to comply
4. **Champions**: Identify and empower policy advocates
5. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Create channels for concerns

**Example**:
```
New Performance Management Policy - Resistance Points:

Concern: "This will increase my workload as a supervisor."
Response: Training shows new process actually reduces time (quarterly
         conversations vs. annual marathon writing session). Provide
         time-saving templates and job aids.

Concern: "This will be used to unfairly target employees."
Response: Policy includes mandatory supervisor training, HR review of
         all ratings, and robust employee appeal rights. Show data
         from pilot demonstrating fairness.
```

## Part 6: Policy Evaluation and Revision (1 hour)

### 6.1 Measuring Policy Effectiveness

**Evaluation Metrics**:
1. **Compliance Metrics**
   - % of employees/supervisors complying
   - Timeliness of actions
   - Error rates

2. **Outcome Metrics**
   - Did policy achieve intended goal?
   - Unintended consequences?
   - Mission impact?

3. **Stakeholder Satisfaction**
   - Employee survey results
   - Supervisor feedback
   - HR staff feedback

**Example - Telework Policy Evaluation**:
```
Goal: Increase telework participation to 40% of eligible employees

Metrics:
  Compliance:
    - 85% of telework-eligible positions identified (target: 100%)
    - Average approval time: 12 days (target: 15 days) ✓
    - 3% of agreements had errors (target: <5%) ✓

  Outcomes:
    - Telework participation: 32% (target: 40%) → Not met
    - Performance ratings: No change (maintained during telework) ✓
    - Office space costs: Reduced by $500K annually ✓

  Satisfaction:
    - Employee satisfaction with telework process: 78% (target: 80%)
    - Supervisor confidence managing remote workers: 65% (target: 75%) → Need more training

Recommendations:
  1. Increase supervisor training on remote work management
  2. Simplify application form (identified as barrier)
  3. Expand eligibility criteria (current criteria too restrictive)
```

### 6.2 Policy Revision Process

**Triggers for Revision**:
- Evaluation shows policy not achieving goals
- New law/regulation requires update
- OPM issues new guidance
- Operational experience reveals gaps
- Audit findings require changes

**Revision Approach**:
- Minor changes: Issue amendment or clarification memo
- Moderate changes: Issue revised policy with track changes
- Major changes: Develop new policy, fully coordinate

## Practice Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Policy Development

Your agency is reorganizing, consolidating 5 regional offices into 2. This will require 100 employees to relocate or separate. You're tasked with developing a policy for relocation benefits and VSIP offers.

**Questions**:
1. What laws/regulations govern this policy?
2. Who are the stakeholders you must coordinate with?
3. What are the key policy decisions to make?
4. What timeline do you recommend?

### Scenario 2: Legal Sufficiency Review

An agency division proposes a policy stating "All employees on performance improvement plans (PIPs) will be ineligible for telework."

**Questions**:
1. What legal issues does this raise?
2. Is this permissible under current law/regulation?
3. How would you revise the policy to address concerns?

### Scenario 3: Congressional Inquiry

A Senator writes: "I was informed by a constituent that your agency denied her telework request because she has young children. Please explain your agency's telework policy and whether this is discriminatory."

**Questions**:
1. What information do you need to gather?
2. What are the potential legal issues?
3. Draft a response (one paragraph).
