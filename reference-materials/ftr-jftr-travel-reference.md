## ⚠️ Important HR Reminders

### Pre-Approval Required
**FTR § 301-2.1**: Travel must be authorized in advance
- Written travel authorization (SF-1012 or electronic equivalent)
- Cannot create obligation without authorization
- Retroactive approvals only for emergencies

### Actual vs. Constructive Costs
**FTR § 301-10.8**: Constructive cost comparison
- If employee chooses POV instead of air, reimbursement limited to airfare
- Example: Airfare $300, POV mileage $500 → Reimburse only $300

### Relocation Tax Consequences
**Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2018)**:
- Relocation expenses are **taxable income** (reported on W-2)
- No more RITA (Relocation Income Tax Allowance)
- Employees should plan for tax liability

### Documentation Requirements
**Receipts required for**:
- Lodging (always)
- Rental car (always)
- Any expense over $75

**Receipts NOT required for**:
- M&IE (per diem, no receipts needed)
- POV mileage (mileage log sufficient)

### Agency Policy May Be More Restrictive
- Agency can limit per diem to lower amount
- Agency can prohibit certain expenses
- Agency CANNOT exceed FTR maximums without waiver
