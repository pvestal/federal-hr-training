## Guided Analysis

### Step 1: Identify All QLEs

In this scenario, there are **THREE** qualifying life events:

1. **Marriage** (September 30, 2025)
   - Authority: 5 CFR § 890.301(f)(1)
   - Qualifies: YES

2. **Spouse's loss of non-FEHB coverage** (November 15, 2025)
   - Authority: 5 CFR § 890.301(g)(3)
   - Qualifies: YES

3. **Birth of child** (Expected May 2026)
   - Authority: 5 CFR § 890.301(f)(3)
   - Qualifies: YES (when event occurs)

### Step 2: Calculate Deadlines

**For Marriage QLE**:

- Event date: September 30, 2025
- Deadline: 60 days from event = **November 29, 2025**
- Today's date: October 25, 2025
- Time remaining: **35 days** ✅ STILL WITHIN DEADLINE

**For Spouse's Loss of Coverage**:

- Event date: November 15, 2025
- Deadline: 60 days from event = **January 14, 2026**
- Can be used as backup if needed

### Step 3: Required Documentation

Jennifer must provide:

1. **SF-2809** (Health Benefits Election Form) - signed and dated
2. **Marriage certificate** (copy acceptable)
3. **Letter from husband's employer** confirming coverage termination date (helpful but not always required for marriage QLE)
4. **Husband's Social Security Number** (for enrollment purposes)

### Step 4: Premium Impact

Current (Self Only BCBS Standard):
- Employee pays: $156.28/biweekly
- Government pays: $372.67/biweekly
- Total: $528.95/biweekly

Estimated New (Self and Family BCBS Standard):
- Employee pays: ~$345-$365/biweekly (estimate)
- Government pays: ~$760-$800/biweekly (estimate)
- Total: ~$1,105-$1,165/biweekly
- **Employee cost increase: ~$190-$210/biweekly**

### Step 5: Processing in DCPDS

1. **Receive and verify** SF-2809 and supporting documents
2. **Check deadline** - Ensure within 60 days of event
3. **Enter in DCPDS**:
   - Navigate to employee record
   - Select FEHB enrollment
   - Change from 104 (Self Only) to 105 (Self and Family)
   - Enter effective date (first day of pay period following receipt)
   - Add family member information (spouse)
4. **Generate SF-50** - Nature of Action 703 (Health Benefits)
5. **Route to payroll** - Premium deductions will change
6. **Notify employee**:
   - Provide confirmation
   - Explain effective date
   - Explain new premium amount
   - Explain that new insurance card will arrive in 2-4 weeks
7. **File documentation** in eOPF

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Mistake 1**: Telling employee they missed the deadline
- Marriage was September 30, today is October 25 = 25 days (within 60-day window)

❌ **Mistake 2**: Confusing the 31-day newborn rule with general 60-day rule
- Adding newborn to SELF ONLY = 31 days
- Employee already has Self and Family = Baby automatically covered

❌ **Mistake 3**: Not explaining the two QLE options
- Marriage QLE (primary)
- Spouse's loss of coverage (backup if needed)

❌ **Mistake 4**: Failing to set expectations on effective date
- Change effective first day of pay period following request
- Not immediate
- New card takes 2-4 weeks

❌ **Mistake 5**: Not preparing employee for premium increase
- Employee cost will roughly double
- Important to communicate this clearly upfront

## Reflection Questions

1. **What would you do differently** if Jennifer contacted you on December 5, 2025 (after the marriage QLE deadline)?

2. **How would this scenario change** if Jennifer's husband was also a federal employee with FEHB?

3. **What if Jennifer wanted to switch to her husband's insurance** instead of adding him to hers?

4. **How would you handle** if Jennifer didn't have her marriage certificate yet because it's still being processed?

5. **What additional counseling** should you provide about prenatal care coverage?
