## Module Overview

Voluntary Early Retirement Authority (VERA) and Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments (VSIP) are powerful workforce shaping tools that allow agencies to reduce staff voluntarily before resorting to RIF. This module provides comprehensive training on implementing these programs.

**Key Principle**: VERA and VSIP are VOLUNTARY. Any coercion or pressure violates law and regulation.

---

## Part 1: VERA Overview (1.5 hours)

### 1.1 What is VERA?

**Voluntary Early Retirement Authority (VERA)**: Temporary authority granted by OPM that allows agency to offer early retirement to employees who don't meet standard FERS/CSRS retirement eligibility.

**Regulatory Authority**: 5 USC § 8336(d)(2) (CSRS), 5 USC § 8414(b)(1)(B) (FERS)

**Normal FERS Retirement Eligibility** (without VERA):
- MRA + 30 years (unreduced)
- Age 60 + 20 years (unreduced)
- Age 62 + 5 years (unreduced)
- MRA + 10 years (reduced by 5% per year under 62)

**VERA Eligibility**:
- Age 50 + 20 years, OR
- Any age + 25 years

**Example**:
```
Employee: Sarah Martinez
Age: 52
Service: 22 years

Normal Retirement: NOT eligible (MRA is 56, doesn't have 30 years)
With VERA: ELIGIBLE (Age 50+ with 20+ years)
```

### 1.2 When Can Agencies Use VERA?

**OPM Must Approve VERA** for one of these reasons:
1. **Restructuring** - Major reorganization or transfer of function
2. **Reduction in Force** - Substantial delayering, reorganization, reduction in force, transfer of function, or workforce restructuring
3. **Re-engineering** - Reengineering to improve efficiency

**OPM Approval Timeline**: 4-8 weeks (submit application well in advance)

**VERA Duration**: Typically 6 months - 2 years (OPM decides)

### 1.3 VERA Annuity Reduction

**Critical Point**: VERA retirements at Age 50-61 are REDUCED annuities.

**Reduction Formula**: 2% per year under age 55

**Example Calculations**:

**Example 1**: Employee retires at age 52 under VERA
```
Years under 55: 3 years
Reduction: 2% × 3 = 6%

Unreduced annuity calculation: 1% × $85,000 × 25 years = $21,250
VERA reduced annuity: $21,250 × (1 - 0.06) = $19,975/year ($1,664/month)

Reduction: $1,275/year ($106/month) for LIFE
```

**Example 2**: Employee retires at age 54 under VERA
```
Years under 55: 1 year
Reduction: 2% × 1 = 2%

Unreduced annuity: $28,000/year
VERA reduced: $28,000 × 0.98 = $27,440/year ($2,287/month)

Reduction: $560/year ($47/month) for LIFE
```

**Example 3**: Employee retires at age 55 under VERA
```
Years under 55: 0
Reduction: 0%

No penalty at age 55+
```

**Counseling Point**: Employees should carefully weigh immediate retirement vs. waiting to age 55 to avoid reduction.

---

## Part 2: VSIP Overview (1.5 hours)

### 2.1 What is VSIP?

**Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment (VSIP)**: Cash payment (buyout) to encourage voluntary separation.

**Regulatory Authority**: 5 USC § 5597

**VSIP Amount**: Lesser of:
- $25,000, OR
- Amount of severance pay employee would receive (if entitled)

**Most employees receive**: $25,000 (maximum)

**Tax Status**: FULLY TAXABLE as ordinary income (not capital gain)

### 2.2 VSIP Eligibility Requirements

**Employee Must**:
1. Serve in agency continuously for 12+ months before VSIP offer
2. Voluntarily separate (resignation or retirement)
3. Not be in receipt of decision to involuntarily separate
4. Not have previously received VSIP from any federal agency

**Key Restriction**: "One and Done" - If employee ever received VSIP before (even from different agency), NOT eligible for another VSIP.

**OPM Database**: Agencies must check OPM VSIP recipient database before offering

### 2.3 VSIP Service Agreement

**Employees accepting VSIP must sign agreement**:
- Will NOT seek reemployment with federal government for 5 years
- If reemployed within 5 years, must repay VSIP before reemployment
- Agreement is legally binding

**Exceptions to 5-Year Bar**:
- Temporary appointments less than 1 year
- Intermittent/seasonal work
- Certain emergency appointments

**Repayment Calculation**:
```
Example: Employee received $25,000 VSIP in 2023, reemployed in 2025 (2 years later)
Years remaining: 3 years out of 5 original = 60%
Amount to repay: $25,000 × 0.60 = $15,000

Employee must repay $15,000 before reemployment effective
```

### 2.4 VSIP Tax Implications

**VSIP is Ordinary Income**:
- Federal income tax withheld (22% minimum for supplemental wages)
- State income tax withheld (if applicable)
- Social Security/Medicare tax withheld (7.65%)

**Example Net Payment**:
```
Gross VSIP: $25,000

Federal tax (22%): $5,500
State tax (5%): $1,250
FICA (7.65%): $1,913

Total withheld: $8,663
Net payment: $16,337

Note: Actual tax may be higher when employee files annual return if in higher bracket
```

**1099-MISC**: Agency issues 1099-MISC (not W-2) for VSIP payment

---

## Part 3: OPM Approval Process (1 hour)

### 3.1 VERA Application to OPM

**Application Must Include**:
1. **Justification**: Explain restructuring/reorganization/RIF
2. **Organizational Charts**: Before and after
3. **Savings Analysis**: Demonstrate how VERA saves agency money
4. **Number of Positions**: Estimate how many employees will accept VERA
5. **Competitive Area Definition**: Which parts of agency included
6. **Duration Requested**: 6 months - 2 years

**OPM Review Criteria**:
- Is there legitimate restructuring/reorganization?
- Will VERA help avoid RIF?
- Is scope appropriate (not too broad/narrow)?
- Will agency achieve workforce goals?

**Approval Timeline**: 30-60 days (plan accordingly)

### 3.2 VSIP Application to OPM

**VSIP Application Requires**:
1. **Statutory Authority Granted by Congress**: Usually in annual appropriations act
2. **Strategic Workforce Plan**: Show VSIP aligns with agency goals
3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Demonstrate savings exceed cost
4. **Number and Amount**: How many employees, total cost
5. **Competitive Area**: Which organizational units included

**OPM Approval Factors**:
- Does agency have statutory authority for current fiscal year?
- Will VSIP help reshape workforce?
- Is cost justified by savings?
- Are controls in place to prevent abuse?

**Approval Timeline**: 45-90 days

### 3.3 Combined VERA/VSIP Programs

**Many agencies offer both simultaneously**:
- Employees eligible for retirement → VERA
- Employees not retirement-eligible → VSIP

**Advantage**: Broader participation, more voluntary separations

**Example Program**:
```
Agency offers VERA/VSIP to entire Logistics Division (500 employees)
  - 150 employees eligible for VERA (age 50+ with 20 years, or 25+ years)
  - 200 employees eligible for VSIP (12+ months service)
  - 150 not eligible for either (new hires, prior VSIP recipients)

Result: 350 of 500 employees (70%) eligible for voluntary program
```

## Part 4: Implementation Best Practices (1.5 hours)

### 4.1 Communication Strategy

**Announcement Timing**:
1. **Week 1**: Senior leadership briefed, OPM approval confirmed
2. **Week 2**: Supervisor training on VERA/VSIP rules
3. **Week 3**: All-hands announcement to employees
4. **Week 4**: Begin individual employee counseling sessions

**Required Communications**:
- Eligibility criteria
- Application deadline
- Approval process (management must approve requests)
- Non-coercion policy
- Resources for decision-making (HR counseling, benefits calculators)

### 4.2 Employee Counseling

**Individual Sessions Should Cover**:
1. **Eligibility Verification**: Confirm employee qualifies
2. **Financial Impact**:
   - VERA: Reduced annuity calculation, show lifetime impact
   - VSIP: Net payment after taxes, 5-year reemployment bar
3. **Benefits Continuation**:
   - FEHB into retirement (requires 5 years enrollment)
   - FEGLI continuation
   - TSP distribution options
4. **Decision Timeline**: When to apply, when decision made
5. **No Pressure**: Emphasize voluntary nature

**Counseling Tools**:
- VERA annuity calculator spreadsheet
- VSIP tax withholding estimator
- Benefits continuation checklist
- FERS retirement application guide

### 4.3 Avoiding Prohibited Practices

**PROHIBITED**:
❌ Coercing employees to accept VERA/VSIP
❌ Threatening RIF if VERA/VSIP not accepted
❌ Targeting specific employees
❌ Creating hostile environment for employees who don't accept

**LEGAL**:
✅ Informing employees RIF possible if voluntary separations insufficient
✅ Explaining benefits of VERA/VSIP
✅ Answering questions honestly
✅ Setting reasonable deadlines

**Example - Legal vs. Illegal**:
```
✅ LEGAL:
"We need to reduce the workforce by 50 positions. We're offering VERA/VSIP
to achieve this voluntarily. If we don't receive enough volunteers, we may
need to conduct a RIF."

❌ ILLEGAL:
"If you don't accept VERA, you'll be the first one RIF'd and you'll lose
everything. This is your only chance to leave with benefits."
```

### 4.4 Management Approval Process

**Agencies may approve or deny VERA/VSIP requests** based on:
- Mission needs
- Loss of critical skills
- Maintaining workforce balance
- Achieving restructuring goals

**Denial Reasons** (Examples):
```
✓ "Employee occupies mission-critical position with no successor"
✓ "Accepting this VERA would leave unit understaffed in essential function"
✓ "Employee possesses unique technical skills required for upcoming project"

✗ "I don't like this employee" → ILLEGAL
✗ "Employee is too old/young" → ILLEGAL DISCRIMINATION
✗ "Employee has filed grievance" → ILLEGAL RETALIATION
```

**Best Practice**: Establish clear criteria BEFORE receiving applications

## Part 5: Processing VERA Retirements (1 hour)

### 5.1 VERA Retirement Application Process

**Timeline**:
1. **Employee applies** for VERA (submit SF-3107 for FERS, SF-2801-1 for CSRS)
2. **Agency approves/denies** within 15-30 days
3. **If approved**: Employee submits retirement application (OPM Retirement Application)
4. **Retirement date**: Minimum 30 days after approval (employee chooses)
5. **Agency certifies**: Send complete retirement package to OPM

**Required Documents**:
- SF-50s showing entire career
- Service history
- Health benefits documentation (SF-2809, 5 years enrollment verification)
- Life insurance election (SF-2817 or SF-2819)
- TSP-70 or TSP-77 (beneficiary designation)
- OPM retirement application (online via OPM Retirement Services)

### 5.2 VERA Annuity Calculation - Agency Responsibility

**Agency Must Calculate**:
- High-3 salary
- Creditable service (years, months, days)
- Reduction percentage (if under age 55)
- Final annuity amount

**Calculation Worksheet Example**:
```
Employee: Michael Johnson
DOB: 08/15/1973 (age 52 at retirement)
Retirement date: 01/03/2026
Service: 23 years, 7 months, 15 days
High-3: $92,500

Base annuity: 1% × $92,500 × 23.625 years = $21,853/year

Age penalty: Age 52 (3 years under 55)
Reduction: 2% × 3 = 6%

Final VERA annuity: $21,853 × 0.94 = $20,542/year ($1,712/month)
```

## Practice Scenarios

### Scenario 1: VERA Counseling

Employee Robert Davis (age 53, 22 years service, High-3 $78,000) asks about VERA.

**Questions**:
1. Is he eligible for VERA?
2. Calculate his VERA annuity (show reduction)
3. What should you counsel him about waiting to age 55?

**Answers**:
1. YES - Age 50+ with 20+ years
2. Base: 1% × $78,000 × 22 = $17,160/year
   Age penalty: (55 - 53) × 2% = 4%
   VERA annuity: $17,160 × 0.96 = $16,474/year ($1,373/month)
3. If waits 2 years to age 55:
   - Service increases to 24 years
   - No age penalty
   - Annuity: 1% × $78,000 × 24 = $18,720/year ($1,560/month)
   - Difference: $2,246/year MORE for life

### Scenario 2: VSIP Eligibility

Employee Sarah Martinez wants to accept VSIP. She has 8 months of service with current agency. Previously worked at Department of Education for 10 years (resigned 5 years ago, did NOT receive VSIP).

**Questions**:
1. Is she eligible for VSIP?
2. If not, what are her options?

**Answers**:
1. NO - Requires 12 months continuous service with current agency (only has 8)
2. Options:
   - Wait 4 more months to reach 12 months service
   - Resign without VSIP
   - Request exception from OPM (unlikely to be granted)

### Scenario 3: VSIP Repayment

Employee accepted $25,000 VSIP in January 2023. Now in November 2025 (34 months later) wants to return to federal service.

**Questions**:
1. Can he be reemployed?
2. How much must he repay?

**Answers**:
1. YES - But must repay portion of VSIP first
2. Calculation:
   Months of 5-year restriction remaining: 60 - 34 = 26 months
   Repayment: $25,000 × (26/60) = $10,833.33
   Must repay $10,833.33 before reemployment effective
