## Module Overview

Reduction in Force (RIF) is one of the most complex and high-stakes HR functions. Errors can result in costly appeals, lawsuits, and damage to agency mission. This module provides comprehensive training on planning and executing RIF actions in compliance with 5 CFR Part 351.

**WARNING**: RIF is an ADVANCED topic. Errors have serious consequences. Always consult with experienced RIF practitioners and legal counsel.

---

## Part 1: When is a RIF Required? (1 hour)

### 1.1 Regulatory Authority

**5 CFR Part 351** - Reduction in Force

**Definition**: RIF releases competing employees from their competitive level in inverse order of retention standing when:
- Abolishment of positions
- Insufficient funds
- Insufficient work
- Reorganization
- Exercise of restoration or re-employment rights

### 1.2 Common RIF Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Abolishment of Positions**
```
Example: Agency eliminates 15 GS-0343-11 Management Analyst positions
due to mission change.
Result: RIF required to determine which 15 employees separated/downgraded
```

**Scenario 2: Reorganization**
```
Example: Department consolidates 3 regional HR offices into 1 centralized office.
Result: Elimination of duplicate positions triggers RIF
```

**Scenario 3: Insufficient Funds**
```
Example: Sequestration reduces agency budget by 20%, requiring workforce reduction.
Result: RIF to reduce full-time equivalent (FTE) count
```

### 1.3 Alternatives to RIF

**Before RIF, agencies MUST consider**:
1. **Hiring freeze** - Stop filling vacancies
2. **Attrition** - Let natural turnover reduce FTE
3. **VERA** (Voluntary Early Retirement Authority) - OPM must approve
4. **VSIP** (Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments) - Up to $25,000 buyout
5. **Reassignments** - Move employees to vacant positions
6. **Retraining** - Train employees for different positions

**RIF is a LAST RESORT** after alternatives exhausted.

---

## Part 2: Competitive Areas (1.5 hours)

### 2.1 What is a Competitive Area?

**Definition**: Organizational and geographic boundary within which employees compete for retention.

**Regulatory Authority**: 5 CFR § 351.402

**Requirements**:
- Must be defined by agency **before RIF announced**
- Must be reasonable and relate to organizational structure
- Cannot be drawn to target specific employees (prohibited!)

### 2.2 Determining Competitive Areas

**Common Competitive Area Definitions**:

**Example 1: Geographic**
```
Competitive Area: "All GS employees in the Pacific Region"
Includes:
  - Seattle Field Office
  - Portland Field Office
  - San Francisco Field Office
Excludes:
  - Headquarters (different competitive area)
  - Other regions
```

**Example 2: Organizational**
```
Competitive Area: "All GS employees in Office of Chief Information Officer"
Includes:
  - IT Security Branch
  - Network Operations Branch
  - Application Development Branch
Excludes:
  - Other offices (HR, Finance, etc.)
```

**Example 3: Combined (Most Common)**
```
Competitive Area: "All GS employees in Logistics Command, Fort Bragg installation"
Boundaries:
  - Organization: Logistics Command only
  - Geographic: Fort Bragg only (not other installations)
```

### 2.3 Prohibited Competitive Area Practices

❌ **ILLEGAL: Gerrymandering**
```
Bad Example: Agency defines competitive area as "Building 5, 3rd Floor, West Wing"
to target specific employees.
Result: Violation of merit principles, subject to OSC investigation
```

❌ **ILLEGAL: Retroactive Changes**
```
Bad Example: Agency changes competitive area AFTER announcing RIF to achieve
desired outcome.
Result: Grievances, appeals, potential lawsuits
```

✅ **LEGAL: Broad, Defensible Boundaries**
```
Good Example: "All GS positions in Division of Procurement, National Capital Region"
Rationale: Logical organizational and geographic unit
```

---

## Part 3: Competitive Levels (2 hours)

### 3.1 What is a Competitive Level?

**Definition**: Positions sufficiently alike in:
- Series
- Grade
- Classification standards used
- Type of position (supervisory/non-supervisory)
- Qualification requirements
- Pay schedule
- Work schedule (full-time/part-time)

**Employees compete only within their competitive level**.

### 3.2 Competitive Level Requirements

**Must Match**:
1. **Same occupational series** (e.g., all GS-0201 HR Management)
2. **Same grade** (e.g., all GS-11)
3. **Same type** (supervisory vs. non-supervisory)
4. **Positions are interchangeable** (qualified employees could perform duties of any position in level)

**Example - Competitive Levels for HR Office**:
```
Competitive Level A:
  - GS-0201-11 HR Specialist (Non-supervisory)
  - 10 positions
  - All perform similar HR generalist duties

Competitive Level B:
  - GS-0201-12 HR Specialist (Non-supervisory)
  - 5 positions
  - Senior-level HR duties

Competitive Level C:
  - GS-0201-13 Supervisory HR Specialist
  - 2 positions
  - First-line supervisors

NOTE: Levels A, B, C are SEPARATE - employees only compete within their own level
```

### 3.3 Special Competitive Level Rules

**Interdisciplinary Positions**:
- Multiple series with similar duties (e.g., GS-301/343 Analyst positions)
- Can be placed in same competitive level IF:
  - Positions truly interchangeable
  - Qualification requirements substantially same

**Trainee Positions**:
- GS-5/7/9 trainee positions
- Separate competitive level from journey level
- Example: GS-343-7 trainee ≠ GS-343-7 full performance level

**Supervisory Positions**:
- ALWAYS separate from non-supervisory
- Cannot combine GS-13 Supervisor with GS-13 Non-Supervisor

---

## Part 4: Retention Registers and Tenure Groups (2 hours)

### 4.1 Tenure Groups (Groups I, II, III)

**Employees ranked in THREE tenure groups** (in order of retention priority):

**Group I: Career Employees**
- Competitive service career employees (completed probation)
- Excepted service career equivalent employees

**Group II: Career-Conditional Employees**
- Competitive service with <3 years service (on probation or haven't completed 3 years)
- Excepted service career-conditional equivalent

**Group III: Indefinite and Non-Status**
- Employees serving under indefinite appointments
- Temporary employees expecting >1 year appointment

**Retention Order**:
1. Group I released LAST (most protected)
2. Group II released second
3. Group III released FIRST (least protected)

### 4.2 Subgroups (A, B, C) - Within Each Tenure Group

**Within EACH tenure group, employees further divided**:

**Subgroup A**:
- Veterans with compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more

**Subgroup B**:
- Veterans with compensable service-connected disability less than 30%
- Veterans entitled to 5-point preference

**Subgroup C**:
- Non-veterans
- Veterans with non-compensable service-connected disability

**Retention Order within Tenure Group**:
- Subgroup A released LAST
- Subgroup B released second
- Subgroup C released FIRST

### 4.3 Retention Register - Complete Order

**Employees ranked in this order (1 = most protected)**:

1. **Group I-A**: Career + 30% disabled veteran
2. **Group I-B**: Career + other veteran
3. **Group I-C**: Career + non-veteran
4. **Group II-A**: Career-conditional + 30% disabled veteran
5. **Group II-B**: Career-conditional + other veteran
6. **Group II-C**: Career-conditional + non-veteran
7. **Group III-A**: Indefinite + 30% disabled veteran
8. **Group III-B**: Indefinite + other veteran
9. **Group III-C**: Indefinite + non-veteran

**Within each subgroup**, employees ranked by:
1. **Performance ratings** (additional service credit, explained below)
2. **Length of service** (years, months, days)
3. **Service Computation Date (SCD)**

### 4.4 Additional Service Credit (Performance)

**Based on Last 3 Years of Performance Appraisals**:

**Fully Successful (Level 3 of 5)**:
- 12 years of additional service credit

**Exceeds Fully Successful (Level 4 of 5)**:
- 16 years of additional service credit

**Outstanding (Level 5 of 5)**:
- 20 years of additional service credit

**Example**:
```
Employee A: 10 years actual service + 20 years credit (3 Outstanding ratings) = 30 years
Employee B: 25 years actual service + 12 years credit (3 Fully Successful) = 37 years

Result: Employee B ranks higher despite Employee A having better performance
```

**If <3 years of ratings**: Assign "Fully Successful" (12 years credit)

---

## Part 5: RIF Process and Procedures (2 hours)

### 5.1 RIF Timeline (Minimum)

**120 Days Before RIF**:
- Establish competitive areas and levels
- Identify positions to be abolished
- Begin VERA/VSIP (if using)

**60 Days Before RIF**:
- Issue Specific RIF Notice to each affected employee
- Notice must include:
  - Competitive area and level
  - Tenure group and subgroup
  - Retention standing
  - Effective date of RIF
  - Employee rights (bump, retreat, appeal)
  - Available job vacancies

**30-60 Days Before RIF**:
- Conduct employee counseling sessions
- Explain bump/retreat rights
- Identify retreat positions
- Process requests for information

**RIF Effective Date**:
- Issue SF-50 (Notification of Personnel Action)
- Nature of Action Code: 351 (RIF - Separation)
  - Or: 352 (RIF - Demotion)
  - Or: 354 (RIF - Reassignment)

**After RIF**:
- Place separated employees on Reemployment Priority List (RPL)
- Monitor for priority placement obligations

### 5.2 Assignment Rights (Bump and Retreat)

**Employees have rights to "displace" lower-standing employees**.

**Two Types of Assignment Rights**:

**1. Bump** (Displacement):
- Move into position at SAME grade
- In different competitive level
- Displaces employee with lower retention standing

**2. Retreat** (Demotion):
- Move into position at LOWER grade
- Formerly held position at lower grade
- Displaces employee with lower retention standing

**Requirements for Bump/Retreat**:
- Must have held position at that grade for at least 52 weeks (non-temporary)
- Must be qualified for target position
- Target employee must have lower retention standing

**Example - Bump**:
```
Competitive Level 1: GS-0201-12 HR Specialist (Benefits)
  - Employee A: Group I-C, 15 years service → REACHED BY RIF
  - No position available in Level 1

Competitive Level 2: GS-0201-12 HR Specialist (Classification)
  - Employee B: Group II-C, 8 years service

Result: Employee A "bumps" into Level 2, displacing Employee B
        (Employee A higher retention standing: Group I vs Group II)
```

**Example - Retreat**:
```
Employee C: Currently GS-0201-13, Group I-C → Reached by RIF
Previously held: GS-0201-11 for 3 years (2018-2021)

Available position: GS-0201-11 (currently occupied by Employee D, Group II-C)

Result: Employee C "retreats" to GS-11, displacing Employee D
        (Must have held GS-11 for 52+ weeks: ✓ YES)
```

### 5.3 RIF Separation vs. Demotion

**Possible RIF Outcomes for Each Employee**:

1. **Retained in Current Position** (No action)
2. **Reassigned** (Same grade, different competitive level via bump)
3. **Demoted** (Lower grade via retreat)
4. **Separated** (Released from agency)

**Separation Occurs When**:
- No bump or retreat rights available
- Employee declines offered position
- Employee not qualified for available positions

---

## Part 6: Common RIF Errors and How to Avoid Them (1.5 hours)

### Error #1: Incorrect Competitive Level Determination

❌ **Mistake**: Placing non-interchangeable positions in same competitive level
```
Bad Example: GS-1102-12 Contracting Officer + GS-0343-12 Management Analyst
             in same competitive level
Reason Wrong: Different series, different work, NOT interchangeable
Result: Grievance, appeal, potential overturn of entire RIF
```

✅ **Correct**: Each series = separate competitive level (even if same grade)

### Error #2: Incorrect Tenure Group Assignment

❌ **Mistake**: Employee with 4 years service classified as Group II (career-conditional)
```
Reality: Employee completed 3-year career-conditional period → Group I (career)
Impact: Employee should have been retained, someone else separated
Result: Lawsuit, back pay, restoration to duty
```

✅ **Correct**: Verify SCD and tenure status for EACH employee

### Error #3: Miscalculating Additional Service Credit

❌ **Mistake**: Using current year rating only (ignoring last 3 years)
```
Example: Employee had 2 Outstanding + 1 Fully Successful = Should be 20 years
         HR used only current Fully Successful = Gave 12 years
Impact: Employee ranked lower than should be → wrongly separated
```

✅ **Correct**: Always use last 3 performance ratings

### Error #4: Not Offering All Bump/Retreat Rights

❌ **Mistake**: Offered only GS-11 retreat, didn't identify GS-9 retreat option
```
Result: Employee separated when had right to GS-9 position
Outcome: MSPB appeal sustained, employee restored with back pay (2+ years)
```

✅ **Correct**: Identify ALL positions employee could bump/retreat to

### Error #5: Inadequate RIF Notice

❌ **Mistake**: Notice issued 45 days before effective date (not 60 days)
```
Result: Procedural violation
Outcome: RIF delayed 15 days, appeal filed, settlement required
```

✅ **Correct**: Always issue notice MINIMUM 60 days (more is better)

### Error #6: Not Consulting OPM/Legal Early

❌ **Mistake**: Agency conducts RIF without OPM consultation or legal review
```
Result: Multiple errors (competitive levels wrong, tenure groups wrong, notices deficient)
Outcome: 8 MSPB appeals, 6 settlements, $400K in back pay + attorney fees
```

✅ **Correct**: Engage OPM and agency counsel BEFORE establishing comp areas/levels

---

## Part 7: Post-RIF Obligations (1 hour)

### 7.1 Reemployment Priority List (RPL)

**All RIF-separated employees entitled to RPL placement** for 2 years.

**Requirements**:
- Agency must offer suitable vacancy to RPL employee BEFORE hiring anyone else
- Suitable = Same grade or lower, same commuting area
- Employee has 5 days to accept or decline

**Penalty for Non-Compliance**:
- Hiring action can be overturned
- Selected candidate removed
- RPL employee placed in position

**Management Tip**: Review RPL BEFORE announcing any vacancy

### 7.2 Priority Placement Programs

**Career Transition Assistance Plan (CTAP)**:
- For employees in agency being RIF'd
- Right to apply for jobs in same agency (different location) before external candidates

**Interagency Career Transition Assistance Plan (ICTAP)**:
- For employees who were RIF'd
- Special consideration for jobs at OTHER agencies
- "Well qualified" = minimum qualifications + exceeds minimum experience

**DOD Priority Placement Program (PPP)**:
- DOD-specific program
- Automated registration and referral system
- Registers RIF'd employees for 2 years

## Practice Scenario: Complete RIF Exercise

**Scenario**:
Department of Defense, Naval Supply Systems Command, Norfolk, VA announces RIF due to budget cuts.

**Competitive Area**: "All GS employees, Navy Supply Systems Command, Hampton Roads, VA"

**Competitive Level 1**: GS-1102-12 Contract Specialist (Non-supervisory) - 8 positions abolished

**Current Employees in Competitive Level 1** (12 total, must reduce to 4):

| Employee | Tenure | Subgroup | Actual Service | Performance (last 3 years) | Additional Credit |
|----------|--------|----------|---------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Adams | I | C | 18 yrs | 3 Outstanding | 20 yrs |
| Brown | I | B (5-pt vet) | 22 yrs | 2 Outstanding, 1 Exceeds | 20 yrs |
| Chen | I | C | 15 yrs | 3 Exceeds | 16 yrs |
| Davis | II | C | 2 yrs | 2 Fully Successful | 12 yrs |
| Evans | I | A (30% disabled vet) | 10 yrs | 3 Fully Successful | 12 yrs |
| Foster | I | C | 12 yrs | 1 Outstanding, 2 Fully Successful | 16 yrs |
| Garcia | II | B (5-pt vet) | 1.5 yrs | 1 Fully Successful | 12 yrs |
| Harris | I | C | 20 yrs | 3 Fully Successful | 12 yrs |
| Ingram | I | B (CP disabled vet <30%) | 16 yrs | 3 Exceeds | 16 yrs |
| Jackson | I | C | 14 yrs | 3 Fully Successful | 12 yrs |
| Kim | II | C | 2.5 yrs | 2 Exceeds | 16 yrs |
| Lopez | I | C | 19 yrs | 2 Exceeds, 1 Fully Successful | 16 yrs |

**Questions**:
1. Rank all 12 employees in retention order (highest to lowest)
2. Which 8 employees will be separated/displaced?
3. Which 4 employees will be retained?

**Answer**:

**Step 1: Calculate Total Service** (Actual + Additional):
- Adams: 18 + 20 = 38 years
- Brown: 22 + 20 = 42 years
- Chen: 15 + 16 = 31 years
- Davis: 2 + 12 = 14 years
- Evans: 10 + 12 = 22 years
- Foster: 12 + 16 = 28 years
- Garcia: 1.5 + 12 = 13.5 years
- Harris: 20 + 12 = 32 years
- Ingram: 16 + 16 = 32 years
- Jackson: 14 + 12 = 26 years
- Kim: 2.5 + 16 = 18.5 years
- Lopez: 19 + 16 = 35 years

**Step 2: Rank by Tenure/Subgroup, then Total Service**:

| Rank | Employee | Group | Total Service | Status |
|------|----------|-------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Evans | I-A | 22 yrs | ✓ RETAINED |
| 2 | Brown | I-B | 42 yrs | ✓ RETAINED |
| 3 | Ingram | I-B | 32 yrs | ✓ RETAINED |
| 4 | Adams | I-C | 38 yrs | ✓ RETAINED |
| 5 | Lopez | I-C | 35 yrs | → Separated |
| 6 | Harris | I-C | 32 yrs | → Separated |
| 7 | Chen | I-C | 31 yrs | → Separated |
| 8 | Foster | I-C | 28 yrs | → Separated |
| 9 | Jackson | I-C | 26 yrs | → Separated |
| 10 | Kim | II-C | 18.5 yrs | → Separated |
| 11 | Davis | II-C | 14 yrs | → Separated |
| 12 | Garcia | II-B | 13.5 yrs | → Separated |

**Answer**: Retain employees #1-4, separate/displace employees #5-12.

**Note**: Group I-A (Evans) retained even though less total service than others - 30% disabled veteran preference is POWERFUL.
